### Use case: Tesla
### Algorithm type: regression (linear)

We decided to use linear regression to predict the stock price because we want the output to be a spesific dollar value and the input to be a spesific date. A classification algorithm would be more suitable if we wanted to get a generalt output, such as stock goes up or down. We also saw that regression algorithms were commonly used to solve this type of task when doing some research.

We tried making the modell fit a logarithmic scale for more accurate results relating to Teslas exponential growth. But we were unsuccessful in making everything work. We managed to plot the data, as seen in the first image below, but had issues when trying to output the dollar values.
