### Use case: Tesla
### Algorithm type: regression (linear)

We chose to use linear regression to predict the stock price because we want the output to be a spesific dollar value and the input to be a spesific date. A classification algorithm would be more suitable if we wanted to get a generalt output, such as stock goes up or down. We also saw that regression algorithms were commonly used to solve this type of task when doing some research.
